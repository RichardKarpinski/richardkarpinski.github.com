	Medical Insurance: Our office participates in many medical insurance plans. When making your first appointment please be prepared to provide your insurance ID number and the name and contact information of your primary care physician. At the time of your first visit, please bring your insurance ID card, and referral (if required).
</p>
<p>
	If you have any questions about your medical insurance, we encourage you to contact your insurance company directly.
</p>
<p>
	Billing Questions: If you have any billing questions regarding your medical insurance or patient billing please contact Macksemize Billing at: 518-828-4900.
</p>
<p>
Participating Provider: If this practice is part of you insurance company's network of healthcare providers (we are participating), we are obliged to accept the insurance company's terms of payment, and agree to collect any co-payment assigned by the insurance company's rules.
</p>
<p>
	We reserve the right to charge a $10.00 service fee in addition to the co-pay if the co-pay is not received at the time services are rendered. For your convenience in paying, we accept cash, personal checks, Master Card, Discover and Visa.
</p>
<p>
	Non-Participatillg Provider: If we are not part of an insurance company's network of health care providers, payment is the patient's responsibility and is due in full at the time services are rendered. You may submit your bill to your insurance company for possible reimbursement.
</p>
<p>
	Referrals: Certain health insurance plans require patients to obtain referrals from their Primary Care Physicians. Patients whose plans require referrals are responsible for obtaining the referral prior to being seen at Upper Hudson Valley, PC or Schenectady Dermatology, PC. If the referral is not received prior to your appointment, you will be asked to sign a patient waiver or to reschedule your appointment for a later date.
</p>
<p>
	Appointment Cancellations: If you are unable to keep your appointment, please notify us at least 24 hours in advance or you will be charged a $50.00 cancellation fee.
</p>
<p>
	Covered Medical Procedure: This is a medical procedure that is the financial responsibility ofthe insurance company. It is the patient's responsibility to know which medical procedure(s) their insurance plan covers. Upon request, we will (if available) supply you with the CPT codes (a number assigned to identify each medical procedure) and the ICD-9 codes (a number assigned to identify a working diagnosis). If you have any questions about your service coverage or your insurance plan, we encourage you to contact your insurance company directly. Contact information is usually located on your health insurance card or online.
</p>
<p>
	Non-Covered Medical Procedure: This is a medical procedure that insurance companies will not pay for. We encourage patients to contact their insurance company prior to
	receiving services, in order to become familiar with the financial responsibility associated
	with having the services performed. Payment is the patient~s responsibility and is due in
	full at the time services are rendered.
</p>
<p>
Cosmetic Procedures: Insurance providers consider these procedures medically unnecessary, or elective. Fees related to a cosmetic procedure are discussed with patients prior to the performance of the operation. Payment is the responsibility of the patient, and due in full prior to the services being rendered.
</p>
<p>
	Payment for non-covered office services is expected at the time of the visit. For non-covered services, usually no insurance submission is involved.
</p>
<p>
	Our cosmetic surgery fees generally follow a preset schedule of prices which we update from time to time; it is compiled with input from practice expenses, national average charges amassed by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, and from surveys of prices in the greater Albany area. Fee quotations will be honored for 6 months from the date of the consultation.
</p>
<p>
	Cosmetic Surgery fee payment is due at the time of surgery.
</p>
<p>
	Arranging surgery involves the schedules of multiple professional people (surgeon, nurse, assistant) and an operating facility. To date we have avoided the approach&mdash;which many other plastic surgery practices take&mdash;of requiring a non-refundable deposit to schedule surgery. Instead, we trust patients to get their payments to us in a timely way. However, if full payment and any required medical clearances are not received by one week prior to surgery, the surgery will be postponed in order to open the facility schedule and professional schedules to other waiting patients.
