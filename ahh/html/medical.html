			Medical Approaches to Treatment
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Medical Approaches
		</h2>
		<p>
			Medical treatments seek to decrease sympathetic nerve stimulation of the glands, to block sweat gland openings, or to produce nerve impulse blockade at the nerve/gland connection.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Dietary restriction
		</h3>
		<p>
			Since hyperhidrosis of all kinds can be made worse by stimulant-containing foods&mdash;especially caffeine and theobromine&mdash;dietary restriction of coffee, tea, cola soft drinks, and chocolate may improve mild cases of hyperhidrosis.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Topical antiperspirants
		</h3>
		<p>
			Most patients with the clinical syndrome try a variety of topical antiperspirants and deodorants, but find no relief until they use 10% or 20% aluminum chloride (Drysol) applied daily. These treatments may be quite effective for mild-to-moderate cases of hyperhidrosis.
		</p>
		<p>
			Shelley and Hurley suggest a more complicated regimen using aluminum chloride hexahydrate or zirconyl chloride in absolute alcohol applied at bedtime, with a plastic dressing applied until morning. They hypothesize that the metallic antiperspirants enter the sweat gland duct and form a plug that blocks the gland's outlet by combining with keratin in the duct lining cells; this treatment may be effective for a week at a time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, skin irritation is very common with these antiperspirants, and often forces discontinuance of the treatment.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Iontophoresis
		</h3>
		<p>
			Tap water iontophoresis is a fairly effective therapy in palm and sole hyperhidrosis, but is more cumbersome and less effective in axillary hyperhidrosis. In this procedure, moistened sponges wrapped around metal electrodes are inserted into each underarm for 20 minutes, and a low-voltage current is applied to the skin several times a week; it produces a stinging sensation. Adverse effects of this method are discomfort with burning, tingling, and skin irritation, including redness and blister formation. Incorrect use may cause burns at sites of minor skin injury. A commonly-marketed brand name is the Drionics device. The mechanism by which iontophoresis produces its sweat-decreasing effect is unknown.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Sympatholytics, anxiolytics, and sedatives
		</h3>
		<p>
			Administration of anticholinergic agents and beta-blockers can be quite helpful in mild cases of hyperhidrosis. Glycopyrronium bromide (Robinul), atropine, propranolol, and a host of anxiolytic (eg, Klonopin) and psychotherapeutic (e.g., Prozac) medications have been used in the treatment of this disorder, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, in all but the mildest cases of hyperhidrosis, the doses of medications required to truly control abnormal sweating often cause significant side effects, including drowsiness, dry mouth, dilated pupils, photophobia, blurred vision, acute glaucoma, impaired urination, reduced bronchial secretions, constipation, confusion, nausea, vomiting, giddiness, tachycardia, palpitations, and arrhythmias. Thus, many patients are forced to discontinue this avenue of treatment.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Radiation
		</h3>
		<p>
			Low-dose topical radiation produces at least transient decrease in local sweat production and has been suggested as a treatment for hyperhidrosis. Postradiation atrophy of the axillary sweat gland layer can be demonstrated. However, potential serious late adverse effects of radiotherapy make this a modality that cannot be recommended as a realistic solution for hyperhidrosis.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Botox injections
		</h3>
		<p>
			Botulinum toxin A (Botox) blocks acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction and in cholinergic autonomic neurons; it thus disconnects axillary sweat glands from their nerve supply. In a recent elegant study, Heckmann et al demonstrated quantitatively the effective safe treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis by intradermal injection of Botox. They also demonstrated the longevity of the relief produced: 24 weeks after the injection of 100 U, the rates of sweat production (in the 136 patients in whom the rates were measured at that time) were still lower than baseline values.
