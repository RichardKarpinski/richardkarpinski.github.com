<H1>What is Axillary Hyperhidrosis?</H1>
<P>Axillary Hyperhidrosis is inappropriately voluminous sweating from
the underarms.</P>
<P><DFN>Primary hyperhidrosis</DFN> is excessive uncontrollable
sweating without any discernible cause. It most commonly involves the
underarms (axillae), palms, and soles but may also involve the face
and groin.</P>
<P><DFN>Secondary hyperhidrosis</DFN> may be caused by endocrine
disorders (eg, thyroid overactivity), hormone-secreting tumors (eg,
pheochromocytoma), sympathetic nervous system disorders, or primary
neurologic or psychiatric disorders.</P>
<P><DFN>Patients</DFN> with axillary hyperhidrosis usually complain
of constant or frequent sweating, with <DFN>streams of wetness</DFN>
running down their sides. This problem wets and ruins clothing and
produces social embarrassment or functional problems from skin
maceration. Severely affected patients also may have resulting
bacterial infections. Unlike functional sweating--which may be
triggered by exercise, exertion, or high temperature--hyperhidrosis
may require no trigger at all, or may be stimulated by emotional
situations and/or anxiety. Most patients with axillary hyperhidrosis
have tried multiple antiperspirants and various medications and often
have devised coping methods dealing with clothing strategies. Many
have consulted various physicians--often to no avail.</P>
<P>Some patients may have unilateral axillary hyperhidrosis or a more
severe problem on one side than the other. Many patients with
axillary hyperhidrosis also are afflicted with palmar, facial, or
plantar hyperhidrosis to some degree.</P>
<P>The problem usually begins with puberty but also may start in mid
childhood, especially in Asian populations.</P>
<H2>What it is not</H2>
<P>Several other axillary conditions may be confused with
hyperhidrosis:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Axillary bromidrosis</B> is chronic offensive axillary
	odor; it may be related to apocrine secretions and to chronic
	bacterial colonization, and antibiotic treatment may be suppressive
	or curative.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Axillary lymphadenitis</B> is inflammation and enlargement
	of underarm lymph nodes.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Axillary hidradenitis</B> is chronic recurring <U>infection</U>
	of the underarm sweat glands, with production of repeated boils and
	sinuses. Once established, the condition may be suppressed, but not
	cured, by antibiotics. Excision of the involved skin and glands is
	the only cure; such resections are generally quite disfiguring. The
	exact cause is unknown, but a hormonal influence appears to be
	involved.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Axillary breast</B> is the presence in the underarm of
	subcutaneous breast tissue, with or without a nipple.</P>
</UL>
<H2>Frequency</H2>
<P>The incidence of hyperhidrosis is uncertain, but Adar's study of a
young Israeli population reported a prevalence of 0.6-1% for palmar
hyperhidrosis; familial involvement was reported in 25% of patients.
The incidence of axillary hyperhidrosis is believed to be similar.</P>
<H2>Cause</H2>
<P>The etiology of axillary hyperhidrosis is unknown, but is related
to increased cholinergic sympathetic stimulation of the sweat glands
in the axilla. Although the glands invariably become remarkably
hypertrophied in this condition, the dramatic glandular growth and
oversecretion is believed to be secondary rather than primary; a
parallel concept is oxyntic cell hypertrophy in peptic ulcer disease
due to vagal hypertonicity.</P>
<P>The observed atrophy of sweat glands in grafted (and therefore
denervated) skin, with reappearance of sweating with reinnervation,
led to the conceptual link between sympathetic tone and acinar
hypersecretion. Further evidence of the neural control of sweat
production comes from the observation that local anesthetic injection
transiently stops hypersecretion of sweat, as does cholinergic
blockade from local injection of botulinum toxin.</P>
<P>While axillary hyperhidrosis almost always begins with puberty, no
direct hormonal connection has been suggested.</P>
<H2>Histology</H2>
<P>Bisbal et al have determined that eccrine and apocrine sweat
glands are mixed in the axilla, with the proportion of 1:1.</P>
<P>In axillary hyperhidrosis, the sweat glands which are responsible
for the problem are restricted to the specialized concentration of
sweat glands of two types (eccrine and apocrine) and roughly
corresponds to the hair-bearing area of the underarm.</P>
<P>In patients with axillary hyperhidrosis, Morgan and Hughes
demonstrated that the apocrine glands are significantly larger and
more numerous than those in axillary hidradenitis and in healthy
control subjects.</P>
<P>Following a thorough resection of the subcutaneous axillary sweat
glands (Skoog procedure), a few eccrine glands remain, and
practically no apocrine glands can be found.</P>
<P>Thus it seems that a Skoog adenectomy is in reality essentially an
apocrinectomy. This is at odds with the observation that the profuse
sweat produced in axillary hyperhidrosis (and stopped by Skoog
resection) is clear and odorless; classically, apocrine sweat is
described as cloudy and odoriferous, while eccrine sweat is labeled
clear and without odor. No one has reconciled these seeming
inconsistencies, but the inference is that the clear odorless profuse
sweating observed in axillary hyperhidrosis comes from the
hypertrophied and overactive apocrine glands.</P>
<H2>The Problem of Recognition</H2>
<P>Axillary hyperhidrosis is a condition that is little recognized by
patients and physicians outside Scandinavia and Great Britain.
Patients who suffer from this condition are often misdiagnosed or
dismissed as having psychosomatic complaints. Worse, various
ineffective therapies are often recommended by &quot;experts.&quot;</P>
<P>In Britain and Sweden, treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis is
generally covered under the respective National Health Service. In
the US, most insurers deny coverage because surgery is not considered
&quot;medically necessary&quot; or because the insurer is either
unaware of the procedures, or considers them &quot;experimental.&quot;
A few insurers routinely confuse axillary hyperhidrosis surgery with
surgery for hiradenitis suppuritiva of the axilla.</P>
