<H2>Surgical Approaches to Treatment</H2>
<P>Surgical treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis involves resection of
the end organ (adenectomy=gland removal) or interruption of
sympathetic innervation to autonomically innervated structures,
including sweat glands.</P>
<H3>Sympathectomy</H3>
<P>Sympathectomy interrupts the sympathetic nerves which stimulate
sweat glands and other structures. The sypathetic nerves can be
isolated and interrupted inside the chest cavity where the
sympathetic chain is identifiable as a visible anatomic structure
near the connection of the second rib with the vertebral column.</P>
<H4>Open sympathectomy</H4>
<P>Open sympathectomy (through an open-chest operation), though still
practiced, is rapidly losing ground to its endoscopic counterpart,
which theoretically achieves the same therapeutic goal with much less
patient morbidity.</P>
<H4>Endoscopic sympathectomy (ETS)</H4>
<P>ETS interrupts or destroys the high thoracic sympathetic chain to
decrease sympathetic tone to the upper extremity and/or face. It is
useful for causalgia, unreconstructable vascular disease, and
treatment of severe frostbite, Raynaud syndrome, and acrocyanosis, in
addition to its usefulness in hyperhidrosis. ETS is carried out under
general anesthesia through one or more small insertion incisions.
Among other things, sympathectomy results in a relaxation of
peripheral arteriovenous connections; this results in vasodilatation
of the skin with increased warmth. It also produces a cessation of
sweating. Beneficial effects reportedly last as long as 5-10 years.</P>
<P>ETS can now often be accomplished on an outpatient basis.</P>
<H4>ETS Contraindications:</H4>
<P>As with any invasive treatment of a non-life-threatening
condition, the risks of hyperhidrosis surgery need to be low. Any
health condition that substantially increases the surgical risk may
make a recommendation for such surgery inappropriate. Specifically,
pulmonary or cardiac pathology may make thoracic surgery, even
endoscopic thoracic surgery, too dangerous for the nature of the
problem.</P>
<P>Patients with only (or predominantly) axillary hyperhidrosis
probably should not be steered toward endoscopic transthoracic
sympathectomy (ETS). Patients with multiple hyperhidrotic sites
should strongly consider ETS before Skoog adenectomy.</P>
<H4>ETS Procedure Details</H4>
<P>Under general anesthsia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube,
with the patient lying supine, on each side two small incisions are
mad between the ribs: one for the endoscopica camera, and the other
to admit endoscopic surgical instruments. One side at a time, the
lung is deflated by the anesthesiologist and the telescope and
instruments introduced. The second rib is identified within the chest
cavity and the sympathetic chain visualized. The pleura is opened
over the symptathetic chain and several sympathetic ganglia
identified (usually T2, T3, and T4). The amount and level of
resection or ablation are individualized somewhat: since innervation
of the head and neck is from T1 to T5, while that of the upper
extremities is from T2 through T9, treatment for facial hyperhidrosis
probably should include the T1 and T2 ganglia, while ablation of T5
probably is required to treat axillary hyperhidrosis. Extensive
proximal dissection of the sympathetic chain (above the T1 ganglia)
may lead to injury of the stellate ganglion, and injury to the
cervical C7 component of this ganglion may result in permanent
postoperative Horner syndrome. The instruments are removed, the lung
reinflated and the incisions closed. A chest tube is not necessary
unless a parenchymal air leak is noted.</P>
<H4>ETS Complications</H4>
<P>In addition to the problems which can be seen after any chest
procedures such as bleeding, infection, incisional problems, and
pneumothorax, patients who have undergone ETS can also experience
compensatory sweating, gustatory sweating, Horner syndrome, eyelid
ptosis, and cardiac effects similar to beta-adrenergic blockade.</P>
<P>In compensatory sweating, patients note increased perspiration
over the trunk and upper thighs, especially in hot weather.
Compensatory sweating may decrease with time, and most patients find
it less objectionable than the hyperhidrosis for which they sought
treatment. If patients are questioned carefully, compensatory
sweating can be noted in as many as 75% of patients undergoing
sympathectomy.</P>
<P>Gustatory sweating is a rare sequela of ETS. These patients
experience the sensation of sweating when they eat, although no
excessive sweat is actually produced.</P>
<P>Postoperative Horner syndrome may occur if portions of the
stellate ganglion are removed or coagulated. This is fairly uncommon
after ETS since the stellate ganglion is well protected by the dome
of the pleura. Eyelid ptosis also may occur following ETS.</P>
<P>Following an extensive thoracic sympathectomy (especially one
extending down to T5), cardiac effects may occur similar to those
produced by beta-adrenergic blockade.</P>
<P>An incomplete sympathectomy may fail to produce symptomatic
relief. Failure to find nerves of Kuntz, if present, also may lead to
a suboptimal result; these extraganglionic sympathetic pathways are
present in at least 10% of patients and must be sought carefully
during the resection procedure.</P>
<H4>ETS Prognosis</H4>
<P>Herbst et al studied 323 patients nearly 15 years after endoscopic
thoracic sympathectomy and summarized their results as follows:</P>
<P>There was no postoperative mortality and no major complications
requiring surgical reintervention. A majority of the patients (98.1%)
were relieved, and 95.5% were satisfied initially. Permanent side
effects included compensatory sweating in 67.4%, gustatory sweating
in 50.7% and Horner's triad in 2.5%. However, patient satisfaction
declined over time, although only 1.5% recurred. This left only 66.7%
satisfied, and 26.7% partially satisfied. Compensatory and gustatory
sweating were the most frequently stated reasons for dissatisfaction.
Individuals operated for axillary hyperhidrosis without palmar
involvement were significantly less satisfied (33.3% and 46.2%,
respectively).</P>
<P>Sympathetic regeneration has been documented in animals and humans
and may result in late recurrence of hyperhidrotic symptoms. In
animals, sympathetic fibers have remarkable regenerative ability,
with regrowth and reinnervation through muscle and scar over time.</P>
<P>To achieve axillary anhidrosis, more extensive and/or more caudal
resection of the sympathetic chain has been advocated, but this also
seems to increase the chances of compensatory sweating and
cardiovascular dysautonomia.</P>
<H2>Axillary resection</H2>
<H3>Skin resection (debulking of gland volume)</H3>
<P>Some authors (Wu et al and others) advocate composite removal of
skin and associated axillary glands to treat axillary hyperhidrosis,
but such resection is likely either to leave behind significant
functional gland tissue or to produce major scarring and limitation
of range of motion. Such resections are more appropriately reserved
for patients with hidradenitis.</P>
<H3>Suction adenectomy</H3>
<P>A liposuction technique has been used to attempt axillary
adenectomy in hyperhidrosis and has been recommended recently by
Lillis and Coleman and Shenaq et al. A small-bore liposuction cannula
is used, with the suction opening turned toward the underside of the
skin. As the cannula is raked across the underside of the skin
bearing the hypertrophic sweat glands, the expectation is that a high
proportion of the glands are either sliced off or disrupted. In the
author's experience, a disappointingly high fraction of patients
treated by this method experienced relapse of abnormal sweating. The
early disappearance of excess sweating is conjectured to be the
result of local denervation and gland disruption; however, as
patients are observed over time, reinnervation and/or gland
regeneration takes place (typically within the first 6 mo
postoperatively), and the symptoms recur. The author has abandoned
this method of treatment.</P>
<P>A variant method of suction adenectomy using ultrasonic
liposuction is thought to produce a better long-term result by
producing more ablation than resection of gland tissue (although this
method is believed to be operator-dependent).</P>
