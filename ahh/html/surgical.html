			Surgical Approaches to Treatment
		</h2>
		<p>
			Surgical treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis involves resection of the end organ (adenectomy=gland removal) or interruption of sympathetic innervation to autonomically innervated structures, including sweat glands.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Sympathectomy
		</h3>
		<p>
			Sympathectomy interrupts the sympathetic nerves which stimulate sweat glands and other structures. The sypathetic nerves can be isolated and interrupted inside the chest cavity where the sympathetic chain is identifiable as a visible anatomic structure near the connection of the second rib with the vertebral column.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Open sympathectomy
		</h4>
		<p>
			Open sympathectomy (through an open-chest operation), though still practiced, is rapidly losing ground to its endoscopic counterpart, which theoretically achieves the same therapeutic goal with much less patient morbidity.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Endoscopic sympathectomy (ETS)
		</h4>
		<p>
			ETS interrupts or destroys the high thoracic sympathetic chain to decrease sympathetic tone to the upper extremity and/or face. It is useful for causalgia, unreconstructable vascular disease, and treatment of severe frostbite, Raynaud syndrome, and acrocyanosis, in addition to its usefulness in hyperhidrosis. ETS is carried out under general anesthesia through one or more small insertion incisions. Among other things, sympathectomy results in a relaxation of peripheral arteriovenous connections; this results in vasodilatation of the skin with increased warmth. It also produces a cessation of sweating. Beneficial effects reportedly last as long as 5-10 years.
		</p>
		<p>
			ETS can now often be accomplished on an outpatient basis.
		</p>
		<h4>
			ETS Contraindications:
		</h4>
		<p>
			As with any invasive treatment of a non-life-threatening condition, the risks of hyperhidrosis surgery need to be low. Any health condition that substantially increases the surgical risk may make a recommendation for such surgery inappropriate. Specifically, pulmonary or cardiac pathology may make thoracic surgery, even endoscopic thoracic surgery, too dangerous for the nature of the problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			Patients with only (or predominantly) axillary hyperhidrosis probably should not be steered toward endoscopic transthoracic sympathectomy (ETS). Patients with multiple hyperhidrotic sites should strongly consider ETS before Skoog adenectomy.
		</p>
		<h4>
			ETS Procedure Details
		</h4>
		<p>
			Under general anesthsia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube, with the patient lying supine, on each side two small incisions are mad between the ribs: one for the endoscopica camera, and the other to admit endoscopic surgical instruments. One side at a time, the lung is deflated by the anesthesiologist and the telescope and instruments introduced. The second rib is identified within the chest cavity and the sympathetic chain visualized. The pleura is opened over the symptathetic chain and several sympathetic ganglia identified (usually T2, T3, and T4). The amount and level of resection or ablation are individualized somewhat: since innervation of the head and neck is from T1 to T5, while that of the upper extremities is from T2 through T9, treatment for facial hyperhidrosis probably should include the T1 and T2 ganglia, while ablation of T5 probably is required to treat axillary hyperhidrosis. Extensive proximal dissection of the sympathetic chain (above the T1 ganglia) may lead to injury of the stellate ganglion, and injury to the cervical C7 component of this ganglion may result in permanent postoperative Horner syndrome. The instruments are removed, the lung reinflated and the incisions closed. A chest tube is not necessary unless a parenchymal air leak is noted.
		</p>
		<h4>
			ETS Complications
		</h4>
		<p>
			In addition to the problems which can be seen after any chest procedures such as bleeding, infection, incisional problems, and pneumothorax, patients who have undergone ETS can also experience compensatory sweating, gustatory sweating, Horner syndrome, eyelid ptosis, and cardiac effects similar to beta-adrenergic blockade.
		</p>
		<p>
			In compensatory sweating, patients note increased perspiration over the trunk and upper thighs, especially in hot weather. Compensatory sweating may decrease with time, and most patients find it less objectionable than the hyperhidrosis for which they sought treatment. If patients are questioned carefully, compensatory sweating can be noted in as many as 75% of patients undergoing sympathectomy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Gustatory sweating is a rare sequela of ETS. These patients experience the sensation of sweating when they eat, although no excessive sweat is actually produced.
		</p>
		<p>
			Postoperative Horner syndrome may occur if portions of the stellate ganglion are removed or coagulated. This is fairly uncommon after ETS since the stellate ganglion is well protected by the dome of the pleura. Eyelid ptosis also may occur following ETS.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following an extensive thoracic sympathectomy (especially one extending down to T5), cardiac effects may occur similar to those produced by beta-adrenergic blockade.
		</p>
		<p>
			An incomplete sympathectomy may fail to produce symptomatic relief. Failure to find nerves of Kuntz, if present, also may lead to a suboptimal result; these extraganglionic sympathetic pathways are present in at least 10% of patients and must be sought carefully during the resection procedure.
		</p>
		<h4>
			ETS Prognosis
		</h4>
		<p>
			Herbst et al studied 323 patients nearly 15 years after endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy and summarized their results as follows:
		</p>
		<p>
			There was no postoperative mortality and no major complications requiring surgical reintervention. A majority of the patients (98.1%) were relieved, and 95.5% were satisfied initially. Permanent side effects included compensatory sweating in 67.4%, gustatory sweating in 50.7% and Horner's triad in 2.5%. However, patient satisfaction declined over time, although only 1.5% recurred. This left only 66.7% satisfied, and 26.7% partially satisfied. Compensatory and gustatory sweating were the most frequently stated reasons for dissatisfaction. Individuals operated for axillary hyperhidrosis without palmar involvement were significantly less satisfied (33.3% and 46.2%, respectively).
		</p>
		<p>
			Sympathetic regeneration has been documented in animals and humans and may result in late recurrence of hyperhidrotic symptoms. In animals, sympathetic fibers have remarkable regenerative ability, with regrowth and reinnervation through muscle and scar over time.
		</p>
		<p>
			To achieve axillary anhidrosis, more extensive and/or more caudal resection of the sympathetic chain has been advocated, but this also seems to increase the chances of compensatory sweating and cardiovascular dysautonomia.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Axillary resection
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Skin resection (debulking of gland volume)
		</h3>
		<p>
			Some authors (Wu et al and others) advocate composite removal of skin and associated axillary glands to treat axillary hyperhidrosis, but such resection is likely either to leave behind significant functional gland tissue or to produce major scarring and limitation of range of motion. Such resections are more appropriately reserved for patients with hidradenitis.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Suction adenectomy
		</h3>
		<p>
			A liposuction technique has been used to attempt axillary adenectomy in hyperhidrosis and has been recommended recently by Lillis and Coleman and Shenaq et al. A small-bore liposuction cannula is used, with the suction opening turned toward the underside of the skin. As the cannula is raked across the underside of the skin bearing the hypertrophic sweat glands, the expectation is that a high proportion of the glands are either sliced off or disrupted. In the author's experience, a disappointingly high fraction of patients treated by this method experienced relapse of abnormal sweating. The early disappearance of excess sweating is conjectured to be the result of local denervation and gland disruption; however, as patients are observed over time, reinnervation and/or gland regeneration takes place (typically within the first 6 mo postoperatively), and the symptoms recur. The author has abandoned this method of treatment.
		</p>
		<p>
			A variant method of suction adenectomy using ultrasonic liposuction is thought to produce a better long-term result by producing more ablation than resection of gland tissue (although this method is believed to be operator-dependent).
