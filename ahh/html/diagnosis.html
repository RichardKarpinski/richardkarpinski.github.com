			What is Axillary Hyperhidrosis?
		</h1>
		<p>
			Axillary Hyperhidrosis is inappropriately voluminous sweating from the underarms.
		</p>
		<p>
			<dfn>Primary hyperhidrosis</dfn> is excessive uncontrollable sweating without any discernible cause. It most commonly involves the underarms (axillae), palms, and soles but may also involve the face and groin.
		</p>
		<p>
			<dfn>Secondary hyperhidrosis</dfn> may be caused by endocrine disorders (eg, thyroid overactivity), hormone-secreting tumors (eg, pheochromocytoma), sympathetic nervous system disorders, or primary neurologic or psychiatric disorders.
		</p>
		<p>
			<dfn>Patients</dfn> with axillary hyperhidrosis usually complain of constant or frequent sweating, with <dfn>streams of wetness</dfn> running down their sides. This problem wets and ruins clothing and produces social embarrassment or functional problems from skin maceration. Severely affected patients also may have resulting bacterial infections. Unlike functional sweating--which may be triggered by exercise, exertion, or high temperature--hyperhidrosis may require no trigger at all, or may be stimulated by emotional situations and/or anxiety. Most patients with axillary hyperhidrosis have tried multiple antiperspirants and various medications and often have devised coping methods dealing with clothing strategies. Many have consulted various physicians--often to no avail.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some patients may have unilateral axillary hyperhidrosis or a more severe problem on one side than the other. Many patients with axillary hyperhidrosis also are afflicted with palmar, facial, or plantar hyperhidrosis to some degree.
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem usually begins with puberty but also may start in mid childhood, especially in Asian populations.
		</p>
		<h2>
			What it is not
		</h2>
		<p>
			Several other axillary conditions may be confused with hyperhidrosis:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<b>Axillary bromidrosis</b> is chronic offensive axillary odor; it may be related to apocrine secretions and to chronic bacterial colonization, and antibiotic treatment may be suppressive or curative.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<b>Axillary lymphadenitis</b> is inflammation and enlargement of underarm lymph nodes.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<b>Axillary hidradenitis</b> is chronic recurring <u>infection</u> of the underarm sweat glands, with production of repeated boils and sinuses. Once established, the condition may be suppressed, but not cured, by antibiotics. Excision of the involved skin and glands is the only cure; such resections are generally quite disfiguring. The exact cause is unknown, but a hormonal influence appears to be involved.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<b>Axillary breast</b> is the presence in the underarm of subcutaneous breast tissue, with or without a nipple.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Frequency
		</h2>
		<p>
			The incidence of hyperhidrosis is uncertain, but Adar's study of a young Israeli population reported a prevalence of 0.6-1% for palmar hyperhidrosis; familial involvement was reported in 25% of patients. The incidence of axillary hyperhidrosis is believed to be similar.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Cause
		</h2>
		<p>
			The etiology of axillary hyperhidrosis is unknown, but is related to increased cholinergic sympathetic stimulation of the sweat glands in the axilla. Although the glands invariably become remarkably hypertrophied in this condition, the dramatic glandular growth and oversecretion is believed to be secondary rather than primary; a parallel concept is oxyntic cell hypertrophy in peptic ulcer disease due to vagal hypertonicity.
		</p>
		<p>
			The observed atrophy of sweat glands in grafted (and therefore denervated) skin, with reappearance of sweating with reinnervation, led to the conceptual link between sympathetic tone and acinar hypersecretion. Further evidence of the neural control of sweat production comes from the observation that local anesthetic injection transiently stops hypersecretion of sweat, as does cholinergic blockade from local injection of botulinum toxin.
		</p>
		<p>
			While axillary hyperhidrosis almost always begins with puberty, no direct hormonal connection has been suggested.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Histology
		</h2>
		<p>
			Bisbal et al have determined that eccrine and apocrine sweat glands are mixed in the axilla, with the proportion of 1:1.
		</p>
		<p>
			In axillary hyperhidrosis, the sweat glands which are responsible for the problem are restricted to the specialized concentration of sweat glands of two types (eccrine and apocrine) and roughly corresponds to the hair-bearing area of the underarm.
		</p>
		<p>
			In patients with axillary hyperhidrosis, Morgan and Hughes demonstrated that the apocrine glands are significantly larger and more numerous than those in axillary hidradenitis and in healthy control subjects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following a thorough resection of the subcutaneous axillary sweat glands (Skoog procedure), a few eccrine glands remain, and practically no apocrine glands can be found.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus it seems that a Skoog adenectomy is in reality essentially an apocrinectomy. This is at odds with the observation that the profuse sweat produced in axillary hyperhidrosis (and stopped by Skoog resection) is clear and odorless; classically, apocrine sweat is described as cloudy and odoriferous, while eccrine sweat is labeled clear and without odor. No one has reconciled these seeming inconsistencies, but the inference is that the clear odorless profuse sweating observed in axillary hyperhidrosis comes from the hypertrophied and overactive apocrine glands.
		</p>
		<h2>
			The Problem of Recognition
		</h2>
		<p>
			Axillary hyperhidrosis is a condition that is little recognized by patients and physicians outside Scandinavia and Great Britain. Patients who suffer from this condition are often misdiagnosed or dismissed as having psychosomatic complaints. Worse, various ineffective therapies are often recommended by "experts."
		</p>
		<p>
			In Britain and Sweden, treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis is generally covered under the respective National Health Service. In the US, most insurers deny coverage because surgery is not considered "medically necessary" or because the insurer is either unaware of the procedures, or considers them "experimental." A few insurers routinely confuse axillary hyperhidrosis surgery with surgery for hiradenitis suppuritiva of the axilla.
