<H1>Ethical, Proficient, Personalized Plastic Surgery in New York City</H1>
<P>In a city full of Plastic Surgeons (and people who call themselves
Plastic Surgeons), this practice distinguishes itself by personal
service, extensive experience, and a commitment to thorough
postoperative care.</P>
<P>Because a patient's safety and satisfaction <U>after</U> surgery
is our measure of success, a thorough and honest pre-op evaluation is
a hallmark of this practice. This means time spent, questions
answered, alternative options investigated, and likely outcomes
truthfully represented. Remember:</P>

<P>Biography</P>
<H2>Biographical Statement:</H2>
<P>Dr. Richard Karpinski was raised in Philadelphia, and moved to
Boston to attend Harvard Medical School. Following graduation in
1971, he remained in Boston to complete a 6-year general surgery
training at Boston City Hospital (Harvard Surgical Service) and The
New England Deaconess Hospital. He practiced as a general surgeon for
two years in the United States Air Force, stationed at SAC
headquarters near Omaha, and received his general surgery
certification from the American Board of Surgery (ABS) during that
time.</P>
<P>At the end of the Air Force commitment, Dr. Karpinski moved to New
York with his family, to train in Plastic Surgery at the NYU
Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery. After completing the
two-year residency, he entered private practice in 1981, affiliated
principally with St.Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital. He was board certified
in Plastic Surgery in 1983.</P>
<P>Dr. Karpinski has been involved in teaching from his undergraduate
years onward: he has taught anatomy, surgery and computer programming
to undergraduates, medical students and surgical trainees. Over the
years, he has had teaching affiliations with Harvard University,
Creighton University, University of Aberdeen (Scotland), and
currently holds a faculty appointment at Columbia University College
of Physicians and Surgeons (P&amp;S).</P>
<P>Dr. Karpinski lives in Manhattan with his wife; their son is a
graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</P>

<H1>What does Board Certification Mean?</H1>

<P>Board Certification of a physician is a rigorous process of verification and validation of:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>licences and credentials</P>
<LI><P>satisfactory medical school study and graduation</P>
<LI><P>full completion of specialty training in an approved residency program</P>
<LI><P>successful performance in strenous certification examinations</P>
</UL>
<P>with the goal of assuring the public and various medical institutions (like hospiatals) about the legitimacy, training, experience and competence of a practitioner. In the USA and Canada, physician board certification is overseen by the ABMS and its component certifying boards.</P>

<H2>What is the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)?</H2>

<P>ABMSLogo.jpg</P>

<P>The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) is the umbrella organization for the 24 approved medical specialty boards in the United States. Established in 1933, the ABMS serves to coordinate the activities of its Member Boards and to provide information to the public, the government, the profession and its Members concerning issues involving specialization and certification in medicine. The mission of the ABMS is to maintain and improve the quality of medical care in the United States by assisting the Member Boards in their efforts to develop and utilize professional and educational standards for the evaluation and certification of physician specialists.</P>
<P>The governing body of each Member Board is comprised of specialists qualified in the specialty represented by the board. The individual Member Boards evaluate physician candidates who voluntarily seek certification by a Member Board of the ABMS. To accomplish this function, the Member Boards determine whether candidates have received appropriate preparation in approved residency training programs in accordance with established educational standards, evaluate candidates with comprehensive examinations, and certify those candidates who have satisfied the board requirements. Physicians who are successful in achieving certification are called diplomates of the respective specialty board. The boards also offer recertification for qualified diplomates at intervals of seven to ten years.</P>

<H2>American Board of Plastic Surgery</H2>
<P>ABPSLogo.jpg</P>
<P>The American Board of Plastic Surgery was founded in 1937 and
officially recognized in 1941, for the purpose of certifying those
found to be qualified after meeting specific intensive educational
requirements and completing a multi-part examination process. A major
reason for establishing the specialty board was to identify the
Plastic Surgeon who has met a certain standard of excellence.</P>
<P>Typically, a successful candidate for ABPS certification must have:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>satisfactorily completed a minimum of 3 years training in another specialty (general surgery, ENT surgery or orthopedic surgery);</P>
	<LI><P>completed the full Plastic Surgery residency (2 or 3 years) in an accredited training program at a major hospital center;</P>
	<LI><P>submitted of patient treatment records to intense scrutiny to demonstrate:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>breadth of experience</P>
		<LI><P>competent and ethical treatment</P>
		<LI><P>accurate record-keeping</P>
	</UL>
	<LI><P>passed both a comprehensive written examination and a separate multi-day oral examination.</P>
</UL>
<P>The ABPS is an independent, non-profit
organization with worldwide recognition. It is one of the twenty-four
certifying boards that are members of the <A HREF="http://www.abms.org/welcome.html">American
Board of Medical Specialties</A>. The Directors of the
American Board of Plastic Surgery are distinguished surgeons in
education, research, and practice in the United States.</P>

A major reason for establishing the specialty board was to identify the surgeon who has met a certain standard of excellence.<P/>
<P>Like the ABPS, the ABS is an independent, non-profit organization with worldwide recognition. It is one of the twenty-four certifying boards that are members of the American Board of Medical Specialties. The Directors of the American Board of Surgery are distinguished surgeons in education, research, and practice in the United States.</P>
<P>For certification the American Board of Surgery typecally requres:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>completion of the full General Surgery residency (5 or more years after medical school) in an accredited training program
	at a major hospital center;</P>
	<LI><P>submission of a comprehensive case log, demonstrating:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P><U>all</U> surgical cases conducted during entire residency program</P>
		<LI><P>proof of experience and competence in the various areas of general surgery</P>
		<LI><P>accurate record-keeping</P>
	</UL>
	<LI><P>passing both a comprehensive written examination and a separate multi-day oral examination.</P>

<H2>American Board of Anesthesiology</H2>
<P>ABALogo.jpg</P>
<P>A committee representing the American Society of Anesthetists,
Inc., The American Society of Regional Anesthesia, Inc., and the
Section on Surgery of The American Medical Association was
established to devise a plan for an organization with the specific
purpose of certifying physicians practicing in the field of
anesthesiology. The formation of <B>The American Board of
Anesthesiology, Inc.</B>, an affiliate of <B>The American Board of
Surgery, Inc.</B>, was completed on June 2, 1937. The Advisory Board
for Medical Specialties and the Council on Medical Education of The
American Medical Association approved affiliation in 1938. In 1941
The Advisory Board for Medical Specialties approved the establishment
of <B>The American Board of Anesthesiology</B> as a separate
primary Board.</P>
<P>The ABA exists in order to:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Maintain the highest standards of practice by fostering
	educational facilities and training in anesthesiology and
	perioperative management.</P>
	<LI><P>Establish and maintain criteria for the designation of a
	Board certified anesthesiologist.</P>
	<LI><P>Inform the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
	Education (ACGME) concerning the training required of individuals
	seeking certification in anesthesia.</P>
	<LI><P>Establish and conduct the certification and recertification process.</P>
	<LI><P>Serve the public, medical profession, hospitals and medical
	schools by maintaining a roster of certified individuals.</P>

<H1>What Does F.A.C.S. Mean?</H1>
<P>ACSLogo.jpg</P>
<P>The American College of Surgeons (ACS) is a scientific and
educational association of surgeons that was organized to improve the
quality of care of the surgical patient by setting high standards for
surgical education and practice.</P>
<P>The ACS admits to its Fellowship only those surgeons whose
professional activity is devoted to surgical practice and who agree
without compromise to practice by the professional and ethical
standards of the College.</P>
<P>The letters FACS (Fellow of the American College of Surgeons)
after a surgeon's name mean that the surgeon's education and
training, professional qualifications, surgical competence, and
ethical conduct have passed a rigorous evaluation and have been found
to be consistent with the high standards established and demanded by
the College.</P>

<H1>What is JCAHO?  And What Does Accreditation Mean?</H1>
<P>JCAHOSealLogo.jpg</P>
<P>The JCAHO (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) was formed over 50 years ago: the first hospital inspections were performed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) in 1918, based on the ACS Minimum Standard for Hospitals. In 1951, the ACS joined with the American College of Physicians, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the Canadian Medical Association to form the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH)--an independent, not-for-profit organization whose primary purpose was to provide voluntary accreditation. In 1952, JCAH took over the hospital standardization program from ACS.</P>
<P>The mandate of the JCAH was gradually expanded to other health care facilities, like Ambulatory Surgical Centers, Nursing Homes, and now Office Operating Facilities. In 1987, JCAH changed its name to the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations to reflect its expanded scope of activities. At present, JCAHO evaluates the quality and safety of care for nearly 17,000 health care organizations. It is the nation's predominant standards-setting and accrediting body in health care.</P>
<BR>
<P>Accreditation is a voluntary process: to earn and maintain accreditation, organizations must have an extensive on-site review by a team of JCAHO health care professionals, at least once every three years. The purpose of the review is to evaluate the organization's performance in areas that affect patient care and safety. </P>
<P>JCAHO accreditation is recognized nationwide as a symbol of quality that reflects an organization's commitment to performance standards, safety, and quality. The scrutiny fosters excellence in care through self-study and external review by one's professional peers.</P>

<H1>What is American Society of Plastic Surgical Nurses?</H1>
<P>ASPSNLogo.jpg</P>
<P>The American Society of Plastic Surgical Nurses
is a national voluntary nursing specialty organization committed to
the enhancement of quality nursing care delivered to the patient
undergoing plastic and reconstructive surgery.</P>
<P>The organization supports and encourages the collaborative
relationship between nurses engaged in the areas of clinical
practice, education, administration and research. It promotes high
standards of plastic and reconstructive surgical nursing through
education, exchange of information, and scientific inquiry.</P>
<P>Certification (CPSN--Certificate in Plastic Surgery Nursing)
requires extensive experience, coursework and examination--all in
Plastic Surgery practice.</P>

<H1>What is ASPS?</H1>
<P>ASPSLogo.jpg</P>
<P>ASPS is the national organization of Plastic Surgeons in the USA
and Canada. It supports its members in their efforts to provide the
highest quality patient care and seeks to maintain professional and
ethical standards through education, research, and advocacy of
socioeconomic and professional activities.</P>
<P>The society acts as a unifying force among member plastic surgeons
and as a source of organizational strength. It serves the public (as
well as its members) by acting as an authority on plastic surgery
procedures, and a source for research information and health policy
issues. The ASPRS also attempts to educate the public and the medical
community about Plastic Surgery, and questions germane to Plastic
Surgery. Its Educational Foundation sponsors research and instruction
in Plastic Surgery.</P>
<P>Because many practitioners can call themselves &quot;Plastic
Surgeons,&quot; the ASPS assists the public by limiting use of its
ASPS 'Symbol of Excellence' to its Active, Life and Corresponding
members.</P>

<H1>Policies</H1>
<H2>Appointment Policy&mdash;including office hours</H2>
<P>Office consultations and visits are by appointment only. Nominal office hours are 9-5, Monday through Thursday.</P>
<P>Because of demand, and days set aside for surgery, new appointments for routine conditions may require 2-3 week--or longer at some times of the year.</P>
<P>Urgent situations are accommodated as appropriate, usually within a day or two.</P>
<P>We can almost always manage emergency situations within a few hours, assuming surgeon availability.</P>
<H2>Privacy Policy</H2>
<P>Please see HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (point to HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices)</P>
<H2>Payment Policy</H2>
<P>Services covered under insurance plans we participate with are submitted in accordance with plan requirements. Balance billing is also per plan stipulations. We try to work with insurance plans we don't participate with--provided there is an out-of-network option.</P>
<P>Payment for non-covered office services is expected at the time of the visit.</P>
<P>Our cosmetic surgery fees generally follow a preset schedule of prices which we update from time to time; it is compiled with input from practice expenses, national average charges amassed by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, and from surveys of prices in the New York tri-state area. Fee quotations will be honored for 6 months from the date of the consultation.</P>
<P>Cosmetic Surgery fee payment is due two weeks prior to surgery.</P>
<P>Arranging surgery involves the schedules of multiple professional people (surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurse, assistant) and an operating facility. To date we have avoided the approach--which many other plastic surgery practices take--of requiring a non-refundable deposit to schedule surgery. Instead, we trust patients to get their payments to us by two weeks prior to surgery. However, if full payment and any required laboratory results are not received by one week prior to surgery, the surgery will be postponed in order to open the operating room schedule and professional schedules to other waiting patients.</P>

<H2>WHAT HEALTH INFORMATION IS PROTECTED</H2>
<P><I><B>We are committed to protecting the privacy of information we
gather about you while providing you with health care. Some examples
of protected health information are:</B></I></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>information indicating that you are a patient of our practice
	or receiving treatment or other health-related services from us;</P>
	<LI><P>information about your health condition (such as a disease
	you may have);</P>
	<LI><P>information about health care products or services you have
	received or may receive in the future (such as an operation or a CT
	scan); or</P>
	<LI><P>information about your health care benefits under an
	insurance plan (such as whether a prescription is covered);</P>
</UL>
<P>when combined with:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>demographic information (such as your name, address, or
	insurance status);</P>
	<LI><P>unique numbers that may identify you (such as your social
	security number, your phone number, or your driver's license
	number); or</P>
	<LI><P>other types of information that may identify who you are.</P>
</UL>
<H2>REQUIRED PERMISSIONS TO USE AND DISCLOSE<BR>YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH
INFORMATION</H2>
<P><I><B>We will obtain a one-time general written consent to use and
disclose your health information in order to treat you, obtain
payment for that treatment, and conduct our business operations. This
general written consent will be obtained the first time we provide
you with treatment or services. This general written consent is a
broad permission that does not have to be repeated each time we
provide treatment or services to you.</B></I></P>
<P>We will generally obtain your written authorization before using
your health information or sharing it with others outside of our
practice. You may also ask that we transfer your records to another
person by completing a written authorization form. If you provide us
with written authorization, you may revoke that written authorization
at any time, except to the extent that we have already relied upon it
or taken action to do what you asked us to do. To revoke a written
authorization, please write to our privacy officer, Dr. Richard
Karpinski.</P>
<H2>HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION</H2>
<H3>1. Treatment Payment And Business Operations</H3>
<P>With your general written consent, we may use your health
information or share it with others in order to treat your condition,
obtain payment for that treatment, and run our business operations.
In some cases, we may also disclose your health information for
payment activities and certain business operations of another health
care provider or pay or. Below are further examples of how your
information may be used and disclosed for these purposes:</P>
<P><B>Treatment.</B> The doctors, nurses and other staff of our
practice may share your health information with each other for the
purpose of treating you. A doctor from our practice may also share
your health information with a doctor outside of our practice to
determine how best to diagnose or treat you. Your doctor may also
share your health information with another doctor to whom you have
been referred for further health care.</P>
<P><B>Payment.</B> We may use your health information or share it
with others so that we can get payment for your health care services.
For example, we may share information about you with your health
insurance company in order to obtain reimbursement after we have
treated you, or to determine whether it will cover your treatment. We
might also need to inform your health insurance company about your
health condition in order to obtain pre-approval for your treatment,
such as admitting you to a hospital for a particular type of surgery.
Finally, we may share your information with other health care
providers who have treated you so that they also can have accurate
information to seek payment from your health insurance company or
managed care plan.</P>
<P><B>Business Operations.</B> We may use your health information or
share it with others in order to conduct our office's business
operations. For example, we may use your health information to
evaluate the performance of our staff in caring for you, or to
educate our staff on how to improve the care they provide for you.
Finally, we may share your health information with other health care
providers and with your health insurance company or managed care plan
for certain of their business operations if the information is
related to a relationship the provider or payor currently has or
previously had with you, and if the provider or payor is required by
federal law to protect the privacy of your health information.</P>
<P><B>Appointment Reminders, Treatment Alternatives, Benefits And
Services.</B> In the course of providing treatment to you, we may use
your health information to contact you with a reminder that you have
an appointment for treatment or services at our facility. We may also
use your health information in order to recommend possible treatment
alternatives or health-related benefits and services that may be of
interest to you.</P>
<P><B>Fundraising.</B> To help raise money in support of the business
operations of hospitals and medical schools with which our physicians
are affiliated, we may use demographic information about you,
including information about your age, gender and where you live or
Work, and the dates that you received treatment. You therefore may
receive fundraising appeals from the doctors at our office on behalf
of the hospitals or medical schools with which they are affiliated.</P>
<P><B>Business Associates.</B> We may disclose your health
information to our contractors, agents and other business associates
who need the information in order to assist us with obtaining payment
or carrying out our business operations. For example, we may share
your health information with a billing company that helps us to
obtain payment from your insurance company. Another example is that
we may share your health information with an accounting firm or law
firm that provides professional advice to us about how to improve our
health care services and comply with the law. If we do disclose your
health information to a business associate, we will have a written
contract to ensure that our business associate also protects the
privacy of your health information.</P>
<P>We can do all of these things if you have signed a general written
consent form. Once you sign this general written consent form, it
will be in effect indefinitely until you revoke your general written
consent. You may revoke your general written consent at any time,
except to the extent that we have already relied upon it. For
example, if we provide you with treatment before you revoke your
general written consent, we may still share your health information
with your insurance company in order to be paid for that service. To
revoke written consent, please write to Dr. Richard Karpinski.</P>
<H3>2. Emergencies Or Public Need</H3>
<P>We may use your health information, and share it with others, in
order to treat you in an emergency or to meet important public needs.
We will not be required to obtain your general written consent before
using or disclosing your information for these reasons. We will,
however, obtain your written authorization for, or provide you with
an opportunity to object to, the use and disclosure of your health
information in these situations when state law specifically requires
that we do so.</P>
<P><B>Emergencies.</B> We may use or disclose your health information
in order to treat you, to obtain payment for that treatment, and to
conduct our business operations if you need emergency treatment or if
we are required by law to treat you but are unable to obtain your
general written consent. If this happens, we will try to obtain your
general written consent as soon as we reasonably can after we treat
you.</P>
<P><B>Communication Barriers.</B> We may use and disclose your health
information in order to treat you, to obtain payment for that
treatment, and to conduct our business operations if we are unable to
obtain your general written consent because of substantial
communication barriers, and we believe you would want us to treat you
if we could communicate with you.</P>
<P><B>As Required By Law.</B> We may use or disclose your health
information if we are required by law to do so. We also will notify
you of these uses and disclosures if notice is required by law.</P>
<P><B>Public Health Activities.</B> We may disclose your health
information to authorized public health officials (or a foreign
government agency collaborating with such officials) so they may
carry out their public health activities. For example, we may share
your health information with government officials that are
responsible for controlling disease, injury or disability. We may
also disclose your health information to a person who may have been
exposed to a communicable disease or be at risk for contracting or
spreading the disease if a law permits us to do so.</P>
<P><B>Victims Of Abuse, Neglect Or Domestic Violence.</B> We may
release your health information to a public health authority that is
authorized to receive reports of abuse, neglect or domestic violence.
For example, we may report your information to government officials
if we reasonably believe that you have been a victim of such abuse,
neglect or domestic violence. We will make every effort to obtain
your permission before releasing this information, but in some cases
we may be required or authorized to act without your permission.</P>
<P><B>Health Oversight Activities.</B> We may release your health
information to government agencies authorized to conduct audits,
investigations and inspections of this office and its staff. These
government agencies monitor the operation of the health care system,
government benefit programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and
compliance with government regulatory programs and civil rights laws.</P>
<P><B>Product Monitoring, Repair And Recall.</B> We may disclose your
health information to a person or company that is regulated by the
Food and Drug Administration for the purpose of: (1) reporting or
tracking product defects or problems; (2) repairing, replacing, or
recalling defective or dangerous products; or (3) monitoring the
performance of a product after it has been approved for use by the
general public.</P>
<P><B>Lawsuits And Disputes.</B> We may disclose your health
information if we are ordered to do so by a court or administrative
tribunal that is handling a lawsuit or other dispute.</P>
<P><B>Law Enforcement.</B> We may disclose your health information to
law enforcement officials for the following reasons:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>To comply with court orders or laws that we are required to
	follow;</P>
	<LI><P>To assist law enforcement officers with identifying or
	locating a suspect, fugitive, witness, or missing person;</P>
	<LI><P>If you have been the victim of a crime and we determine that:
	(1) we have been unable to obtain your agreement because of an
	emergency or your incapacity; (2) law enforcement officials need
	this information immediately to carry out their law enforcement
	duties; and (3) in our professional judgment disclosure to these
	officers is in your best interests;</P>
	<LI><P>If we suspect that your death resulted from criminal
	conduct;</P>
	<LI><P>If necessary to report a crime that occurred on our property;
	or</P>
	<LI><P>If necessary to report a crime discovered during an offsite
	medical emergency (for example, by emergency medical technicians at
	the scene of a crime).</P>
</UL>
<P><B>To Avert A Serious And Imminent Threat To Health Or Safety.</B>
We may use your health information or share it with others when
necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to your health or
safety, or the health or safety of another person or the public. In
such cases, we will only share your information with someone able to
help prevent the threat. We may also disclose your health information
to law enforcement officers if you tell us that you participated in a
violent crime that may have caused serious physical harm to another
person (unless you admitted that fact while in counseling), or if we
determine that you escaped from lawful custody (such as a prison or
mental health institution).</P>
<P><B>National Security And Intelligence Activities Or Protective
Services.</B> We may disclose your health information to authorized
federal officials who are conducting national security and
intelligence activities or providing protective services to the
President or other important officials.</P>
<P><B>Military And Veterans.</B> If you are in the Armed Forces, we
may disclose health information about you to appropriate military
command authorities for activities they deem necessary to carry out
their military mission. We may also release health information about
foreign military personnel to the appropriate foreign military
authority.</P>
<P><B>Workers' Compensation.</B> We may disclose your health
information for workers' compensation or similar programs that
provide benefits for work-related injuries.</P>
<P><B>Coroners, Medical Examiners, And Funeral Directors.</B> In the
unfortunate event of your death, we may disclose your health
information to a coroner or medical examiner. This may be necessary,
for example, to determine the cause of death. We may also release
this information to funeral directors as necessary to carry out their
duties.</P>
<P><B>Organ And Tissue Donation.</B> In the unfortunate event of your
death, we may disclose your health information to organizations that
procure or store organs, eyes or other tissues so that these
organizations may investigate whether donation or transplantation is
possible under applicable laws.</P>
<P><B>Research.</B> In most cases, we will ask for your written
authorization before using your health information or sharing it with
others in order to conduct research. However, under some
circumstances, we may use and disclose your health information for
research without your written authorization if we obtain approval
through a special process to ensure that research without your
written authorization poses minimal risk to your privacy. Under no
circumstances, however, would we allow researchers to use your name
or identity publicly. We may also release your health information
without your written authorization to people who are preparing a
future research project, so long as any information identifying you
does not leave our office. In the unfortunate event of your death, we
may share your health information with people who are conducting
research using the information of deceased persons, as long as they
agree not to remove from our facility any information that identifies
you.</P>
<H3>3. Incidental Disclosures</H3>
<P>While we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of
your health information, certain disclosures of your health
information may occur during or as an unavoidable result of our
otherwise permissible uses or disclosures of your health information.
For example, during the course of a treatment session, other patients
in the treatment area may see, or overhear discussion of, your health
information.</P>
<H2>YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION</H2>
<P><I><B>We want you to know that you have the following rights to
access and control your health information. These rights are
important because they will help you make sure that the health
information we have about you is accurate. They may also help you
control the way we use your information and share it with others, or
the way we communicate with you about your medical matters.</B></I></P>
<H3>1. Right To Inspect And Copy Records</H3>
<P>You have the right to inspect and obtain a copy of any of your
health information that may be used to make decisions about you and
your treatment for as long as we maintain this information in our
records. This includes medical and billing records. To inspect or
obtain a copy of your health information, please submit your request
in writing to Dr. Richard Karpinski. If you request a copy of the
information, we may charge a fee for the costs of copying, mailing or
other supplies we use to fulfill your request. The standard fee is
$0.75 per page and must generally be paid before or at the time we
give the copies to you.</P>
<P>We will respond to your request for inspection of records within
10 days. We ordinarily will respond to requests for copies within 30
days if the information is located at our office, and within 60 days
if it is located off-site at another facility. If we need additional
time to respond to a request for copies, we will notify you in
writing within the timeframe above to explain the reason for the
delay and when you can expect to have a final answer to your request.</P>
<P>Under certain very limited circumstances, we may deny your request
to inspect or obtain a copy of your information. If we do, we will
provide you with a summary of the information instead. We will also
provide a written notice that explains our reasons for providing only
a summary, and a complete description of your rights to have that
decision reviewed and how you can exercise those rights. The notice
will also include information on how to file a complaint about these
issues with us or with the Secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services. If we have reason to deny only part of your request,
we will provide complete access to the remaining parts after
excluding the information we cannot let you inspect or copy.</P>
<H3>2. Right To Amend Records</H3>
<P>If you believe that the health information we have about you is
incorrect or incomplete, you may ask us to amend the information. You
have the right to request an amendment for as long as the information
is kept in our records. To request an amendment, please write to Dr.
Richard Karpinski. Your request should include the reason(s) why you
think we should make the amendment. Ordinarily we will respond to
your request within 60 days. If we need additional time to respond,
we will notify you in writing within 60 days to explain the reason
for the delay and when you can expect to have a final answer to your
request.</P>
<P>If we deny part or all of your request, we will provide a written
notice that explains our reasons for doing so. You will have the
right to have certain information related to your requested amendment
included in your records. For example, if you disagree with our
decision, you will have an opportunity to submit a statement
explaining your disagreement which we will include in your records.
We will also include information on how to file a complaint with us
or with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.
These procedures will be explained in more detail in any written
denial notice we send you.</P>
<H3>3. Right To An Accounting Of Disclosures</H3>
<P>After April 14, 2003, you have a right to request an &quot;accounting
of disclosures&quot; which identifies certain other persons or
organizations to whom we have disclosed your health information in
accordance with applicable law and the protections afforded in this
Notice of Privacy Practices. An accounting of disclosures does not
describe the ways that your health information has been shared
between health care providers at our office or with other health care
providers outside our practice, as long as all other protections
described in this Notice of Privacy Practices have been followed
(such as obtaining the required approvals before sharing your health
information with our doctors for research purposes).</P>
<P>An accounting of disclosures also does <U>not</U> include
information about the following disclosures:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Disclosures we made to you or your personal representative;</P>
	<LI><P>Disclosures we made pursuant to your written authorization;</P>
	<LI><P>Disclosures we made for treatment, payment or business
	operations;</P>
	<LI><P>Disclosures made to your friends and family involved in your
	care or payment for your care;</P>
	<LI><P>Disclosures that were incidental to permissible uses and
	disclosures of your health information (for example, when
	information is overheard by another patient passing by);</P>
	<LI><P>Disclosures for purposes of research, public health or our
	business operations of limited portions of your health information
	that do not directly identify you;</P>
	<LI><P>Disclosures made to federal officials for national security
	and intelligence activities;</P>
	<LI><P>Disclosures about inmates to correctional institutions or law
	enforcement officers; and</P>
	<LI><P>Disclosures made before April 14, 2003.</P>
</UL>
<P>To request an accounting of disclosures, please write to Dr.
Richard Karpinski. Your request must state a time period within the
past six years (but after April 14,2003) for the disclosures you want
us to include. For example, you may request a list of the disclosures
that we made between January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2005. You have a
right to receive one accounting within every 12 month period for
free. However, we may charge you for the cost of providing any
additional accounting in that same 12 month period. We will always
notify you of any cost involved so that you may choose to withdraw or
modify your request before any costs are incurred.</P>
<P>We will respond to your request for an accounting within 60 days.
If we need additional time to prepare the accounting you have
requested, we will notify you in writing about the reason for the
delay and the date when you can expect to receive the accounting. In
rare cases, we may have to delay providing you with the accounting
without notifying you because a law enforcement official or
government agency has asked us to do so.</P>
<H3>4. Right To Request Additional Privacy Protections</H3>
<P>You have the right to request that we further restrict the way we
use and disclose your health information to treat your condition,
collect payment for that treatment, or run our business operations.
You may also request that we limit how we disclose information about
you to family or friends involved in your care or payment for your
care. For example, you could request that we not disclose information
about a surgery you had. To request restrictions, please write to Dr.
Richard Karpinski. Your request should include (1) what information
you want to limit; (2) whether you want to limit how we use the
information, how we share it with others, or both; and (3) to whom
you want the limits to apply.</P>
<P>We are not required to agree to your request for a restriction,
and in some cases the restriction you request may not be permitted
under law. However, if we do agree, we will be bound by our agreement
unless the information is needed to provide you with emergency
treatment or comply with the law. Once we have agreed to a
restriction, you have the right to revoke the restriction at any
time. Under some circumstances, we will also have the right to revoke
the restriction as long as we notify you before doing so; in other
cases, we will need your permission before we can revoke the
restriction.</P>
<H3>5. Right To Request Confidential Communications</H3>
<P>You have the right to request that we communicate with you about
your medical matters in a more confidential way by requesting that we
communicate with you by alternative means or at alternative
locations. For example, you may ask that we contact you at home
instead of at work. To request more confidential communications,
please write to Dr. Richard Karpinski. We will not ask you the reason
for your request, and we will try to accommodate all reasonable
requests. Please specify in your request how or where you wish to be
contacted, and how payment for your health care will be handled if we
communicate with you through this alternative method or location.</P>
<H3>6. Right To Have Someone Act On Your Behalf</H3>
<P>You have the right to name a personal representative who may act
on your behalf to control the privacy of your health information.
Parents and guardians will generally have the right to control the
privacy of health information about minors unless the minors are
permitted by law to act on their own behalf.</P>
<H3>7. Right To Obtain A Copy Of Notices</H3>
<P>If this notice is provided electronically, you have the right to a
paper copy of this notice, which you may request at any time. To do
so, please call our office at (212) 977-9797. You may also obtain a
copy of this notice by requesting a copy at your next visit. We may
change our privacy practices from time to time. If we do, we will
revise this notice so you will have an accurate summary of our
practices. We will post any revised notice in our office reception
area. You will also be able to obtain your own copy of the revised
notice. The effective date of the notice will always be noted in the
top right comer of the first page. We are required to abide by the
terms of the notice that is currently in effect.</P>
<H3>8. Right To File A Complaint</H3>
<P>If you believe your privacy rights have been violated, you may
file a complaint with us or with the Secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services. To file a complaint with us, please
contact our Privacy Officer, Dr. Richard Karpinski. No one will
retaliate or take action against you for filing a complaint.</P>
<H3>9. How To Learn About Special Protections For HIV, Alcohol and
Substance Abuse, Mental Health. And Genetic Information</H3>
<P>Special privacy protections apply to HIV/AIDS-related information,
mental health information and psychotherapy notes. Some parts of this
general Notice of Privacy Practices may not apply to these types of
information. To request a Notice of Privacy Practices that pertains
to those types of health information, please contact our Privacy
Officer, Dr. Richard Karpinski.</P>
