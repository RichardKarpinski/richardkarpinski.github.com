Dear Stefan:

Hope you had a good music time on Sunday.

Enclosed are two files:

  sitemap.html, and ahh.html


The site map is a first pass at a site map and a site structure: not at
all cut in stone.

ahh is a file that contains the content for much of the AHH web site,
which will be put up at www.axillaryhyperhidrosis.com

It needs to be broken up into smaller chunks, each of which will be one
of the top-level pages; I'm not sure which way would make the most sense
to do this, but you may well have some clear ideas upon reading it. I'm
eager to hear your suggestions in that regard.

The reference for my book chapter (also one of the top line navigation
items) is

http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic530.htm


The AHH site then needs pictures, somehow; FAQ; and Related Links

While you are working on this, I will continue with FAQ, and bits and
pieces of the Karpinskimd site.

Thanks,
--OD

<H1>What is Axillary Hyperhidrosis?</H1>
<P>Axillary Hyperhidrosis is inappropriately voluminous sweating from
the underarms.</P>
<P><DFN>Primary hyperhidrosis</DFN> is excessive uncontrollable
sweating without any discernible cause. It most commonly involves the
underarms (axillae), palms, and soles but may also involve the face
and groin.</P>
<P><DFN>Secondary hyperhidrosis</DFN> may be caused by endocrine
disorders (eg, thyroid overactivity), hormone-secreting tumors (eg,
pheochromocytoma), sympathetic nervous system disorders, or primary
neurologic or psychiatric disorders.</P>
<P><DFN>Patients</DFN> with axillary hyperhidrosis usually complain
of constant or frequent sweating, with <DFN>streams of wetness</DFN>
running down their sides. This problem wets and ruins clothing and
produces social embarrassment or functional problems from skin
maceration. Severely affected patients also may have resulting
bacterial infections. Unlike functional sweating--which may be
triggered by exercise, exertion, or high temperature--hyperhidrosis
may require no trigger at all, or may be stimulated by emotional
situations and/or anxiety. Most patients with axillary hyperhidrosis
have tried multiple antiperspirants and various medications and often
have devised coping methods dealing with clothing strategies. Many
have consulted various physicians--often to no avail.</P>
<P>Some patients may have unilateral axillary hyperhidrosis or a more
severe problem on one side than the other. Many patients with
axillary hyperhidrosis also are afflicted with palmar, facial, or
plantar hyperhidrosis to some degree.</P>
<P>The problem usually begins with puberty but also may start in mid
childhood, especially in Asian populations.</P>
<H2>Diagnosis</H2>
<P>The diagnosis of axillary hyperhidrosis is made from patient
history and from visible signs of excessive sweating. No formal
staging or severity scale exists, but the terms mild, moderate, and
severe are used in some clinical descriptions.</P>
<H2>Prognosis</H2>
<P>Although untreated hyperhidrosis may become gradually less severe
with age, it tends to remain a permanently annoying or disabling
condition.</P>
<H2>Testing</H2>
<H3>Blood and Urine</H3>
<P>Laboratory blood and urine tests may play a vital role in
excluding <U>secondary</U> hyperhidrosis from causes such as
hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, carcinoid or other malignancy,
tuberculosis, or adrenal pathology, especially in patients with
asymmetric, late, or atypical onset of symptoms. 
</P>
<H3>Sweat Tests</H3>
<P>Heckmann et al<!--insert reference--> have described a gravimetric
method for quantitating sweat production, in which filter paper is
weighed dry on a high-precision laboratory scale, then placed in
contact with a hyperhidrotic area of patient skin for 60 seconds,
then weighed again. They found the rate of sweat production in
hyperhidrotic areas to be near 200 mg/min.</P>
<P>Minor's iodine starch test has been used for many years to map the
areas of axillary hypersecretion.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The axilla is dried thoroughly, painted with an iodine
	tincture, then air-dried and dusted with cornstarch or potato flour.
	As the patient begins to sweat, moistened starch combines with the
	iodine to produce a vivid blue color. The hyperhidrotic areas then
	can be mapped and outlined with an indelible felt-tip marker. (See
	figures)</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>A variant version of this test uses ninhydrin solution
	sprayed on an air-dried axilla, relying on color reaction with
	proteinaceous sweat to produce a visible pattern.</P>
</UL>
<P>In practice, gravimetric measurement of sweat production is seldom
used. Iodine mapping is also of limited usefulness as a prelude to
surgery, since the hyperhidrotic area usually corresponds quite
closely to the hair-bearing area of the axilla; however, mapping may
be extremely helpful in pinpointing an area of recurrence (or failed
gland resection) in patients who require reoperation.</P>
<P>Skin temperature and electrical conductivity may be used during
ETS surgery to gauge sympathectomy effect, but they are rarely needed
prior to surgery.</P>
<H2>What it is not</H2>
<P>Several other axillary conditions may be confused with
hyperhidrosis:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Axillary bromidrosis</B> is chronic offensive axillary
	odor; it may be related to apocrine secretions and to chronic
	bacterial colonization, and antibiotic treatment may be suppressive
	or curative.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Axillary lymphadenitis</B> is inflammation and enlargement
	of underarm lymph nodes.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Axillary hidradenitis</B> is chronic recurring <U>infection</U>
	of the underarm sweat glands, with production of repeated boils and
	sinuses. Once established, the condition may be suppressed, but not
	cured, by antibiotics. Excision of the involved skin and glands is
	the only cure; such resections are generally quite disfiguring. The
	exact cause is unknown, but a hormonal influence appears to be
	involved.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Axillary breast</B> is the presence in the underarm of
	subcutaneous breast tissue, with or without a nipple.</P>
</UL>
<H2>Frequency</H2>
<P>The incidence of hyperhidrosis is uncertain, but Adar's study of a
young Israeli population reported a prevalence of 0.6-1% for palmar
hyperhidrosis; familial involvement was reported in 25% of patients.
The incidence of axillary hyperhidrosis is believed to be similar.</P>
<H2>Cause</H2>
<P>The etiology of axillary hyperhidrosis is unknown, but is related
to increased cholinergic sympathetic stimulation of the sweat glands
in the axilla. Although the glands invariably become remarkably
hypertrophied in this condition, the dramatic glandular growth and
oversecretion is believed to be secondary rather than primary; a
parallel concept is oxyntic cell hypertrophy in peptic ulcer disease
due to vagal hypertonicity.</P>
<P>The observed atrophy of sweat glands in grafted (and therefore
denervated) skin, with reappearance of sweating with reinnervation,
led to the conceptual link between sympathetic tone and acinar
hypersecretion. Further evidence of the neural control of sweat
production comes from the observation that local anesthetic injection
transiently stops hypersecretion of sweat, as does cholinergic
blockade from local injection of botulinum toxin.</P>
<P>While axillary hyperhidrosis almost always begins with puberty, no
direct hormonal connection has been suggested.</P>
<H2>Histology</H2>
<P>Bisbal et al have determined that eccrine and apocrine sweat
glands are mixed in the axilla, with the proportion of 1:1.</P>
<P>In axillary hyperhidrosis, the sweat glands which are responsible
for the problem are restricted to the specialized concentration of
sweat glands of two types (eccrine and apocrine) and roughly
corresponds to the hair-bearing area of the underarm.</P>
<P>In patients with axillary hyperhidrosis, Morgan and Hughes
demonstrated that the apocrine glands are significantly larger and
more numerous than those in axillary hidradenitis and in healthy
control subjects.</P>
<P>Following a thorough resection of the subcutaneous axillary sweat
glands (Skoog procedure), a few eccrine glands remain, and
practically no apocrine glands can be found.</P>
<P>Thus it seems that a Skoog adenectomy is in reality essentially an
apocrinectomy. This is at odds with the observation that the profuse
sweat produced in axillary hyperhidrosis (and stopped by Skoog
resection) is clear and odorless; classically, apocrine sweat is
described as cloudy and odoriferous, while eccrine sweat is labeled
clear and without odor. No one has reconciled these seeming
inconsistencies, but the inference is that the clear odorless profuse
sweating observed in axillary hyperhidrosis comes from the
hypertrophied and overactive apocrine glands.</P>
<H2>The Problem of Recognition</H2>
<P>Axillary hyperhidrosis is a condition that is little recognized by
patients and physicians outside Scandinavia and Great Britain.
Patients who suffer from this condition are often misdiagnosed or
dismissed as having psychosomatic complaints. Worse, various
ineffective therapies are often recommended by &quot;experts.&quot;</P>
<P>In Britain and Sweden, treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis is
generally covered under the respective National Health Service. In
the US, most insurers deny coverage because surgery is not considered
&quot;medically necessary&quot; or because the insurer is either
unaware of the procedures, or considers them &quot;experimental.&quot;
A few insurers routinely confuse axillary hyperhidrosis surgery with
surgery for hiradenitis suppuritiva of the axilla.</P>
<H1>Treatment</H1>
<H2>Medical Approaches</H2>
<P>Medical treatments seek to decrease sympathetic nerve stimulation
of the glands, to block sweat gland openings, or to produce nerve
impluse blockade at the nerve/gland connection. 
</P>
<H3>Dietary restriction</H3>
<P>Since hyperhidrosis of all kinds can be made worse by
stimulant-containing foods, especially caffeine and theobromine,
dietary restriction of coffee, tea, cola soft drinks, and chocolate
may improve mild cases of hyperhidrosis.</P>
<H3>Topical antiperspirants</H3>
<P>Most patients with the clinical syndrome try a variety of topical
antiperspirants and deodorants, but find no relief until they use 10%
or 20% aluminum chloride (Drysol) applied daily. These treatments may
be quite effective for mild-to-moderate cases of hyperhidrosis.</P>
<P>Shelley and Hurley suggest a more complicated regimen using
aluminum chloride hexahydrate or zirconyl chloride in absolute
alcohol applied at bedtime, with a plastic dressing applied until
morning. They hypothesize that the metallic antiperspirants enter the
sweat gland duct and form a plug that blocks the gland's outlet by
combining with keratin in the duct lining cells; this treatment may
be effective for a week at a time.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, skin irritation is very common with these
antiperspirants, and often forces discontinuance of the treatment.</P>
<H3>Iontophoresis</H3>
<P>Tap water iontophoresis is a fairly effective therapy in palm and
sole hyperhidrosis, but is more cumbersome and less effective in
axillary hyperhidrosis. In this procedure, moistened sponges wrapped
around metal electrodes are inserted into each underarm for 20
minutes, and a low-voltage current is applied to the skin several
times a week; it produces a stinging sensation. Adverse effects of
this method are discomfort with burning, tingling, and skin
irritation, including redness and blister formation. Incorrect use
may cause burns at sites of minor skin injury. A commonly-marketed
brand name is the Drionics device. The mechanism by which
iontophoresis produces its sweat-decreasing effect is unknown.</P>
<H3>Sympatholytics, anxiolytics, and sedatives</H3>
<P>Administration of anticholinergic agents and beta-blockers can be
quite helpful in mild cases of hyperhidrosis. Glycopyrronium bromide
(Robinul), atropine, propranolol, and a host of anxiolytic (eg,
Klonopin) and psychotherapeutic (eg, Prozac) medications have been
used in the treatment of this disorder, with varying degrees of
success. Unfortunately, in all but the mildest cases of
hyperhidrosis, the doses of medications required to truly control
abnormal sweating often cause significant side effects, including
drowsiness, dry mouth, dilated pupils, photophobia, blurred vision,
acute glaucoma, impaired urination, reduced bronchial secretions,
constipation, confusion, nausea, vomiting, giddiness, tachycardia,
palpitations, and arrhythmias. Thus, many patients are forced to
discontinue this avenue of treatment.</P>
<H3>Radiation</H3>
<P>Low-dose topical radiation produces at least transient decrease in
local sweat production and has been suggested as a treatment for
hyperhidrosis. Postradiation atrophy of the axillary sweat gland
layer can be demonstrated. However, potential serious late adverse
effects of radiotherapy make this a modality that cannot be
recommended as a realistic solution for hyperhidrosis.</P>
<H3>Botox injections</H3>
<P>Botulinum toxin A (Botox) blocks acetylcholine release at the
neuromuscular junction and in cholinergic autonomic neurons; it thus
disconnects axillary sweat glands from their nerve supply. In a
recent elegant study, Heckmann et al demonstrated quantitatively the
effective safe treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis by intradermal
injection of Botox. They also demonstrated the longevity of the
relief produced: 24 weeks after the injection of 100 U, the rates of
sweat production (in the 136 patients in whom the rates were measured
at that time) were still lower than baseline values.</P>
<H2>Surgical Approaches</H2>
<P>Surgical treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis involves resection of
the end organ (adenectomy=gland removal) or interruption of
sympathetic innervation to autonomically innervated structures,
including sweat glands.</P>
<H3>Sympathectomy</H3>
<P>Sympathectomy interrupts the sympathetic nerves which stimulate
sweat glands and other structures. The sypathetic nerves can be
isolated and interrupted inside the chest cavity where the
sympathetic chain is identifiable as a visible anatomic structure
near the connection of the second rib with the vertebral column.</P>
<H4>Open sympathectomy</H4>
<P>Open sympathectomy (through an open-chest operation), though still
practiced, is rapidly losing ground to its endoscopic counterpart,
which theoretically achieves the same therapeutic goal with much less
patient morbidity.</P>
<H4>Endoscopic sympathectomy (ETS)</H4>
<P>ETS interrupts or destroys the high thoracic sympathetic chain to
decrease sympathetic tone to the upper extremity and/or face. It is
useful for causalgia, unreconstructable vascular disease, and
treatment of severe frostbite, Raynaud syndrome, and acrocyanosis, in
addition to its usefulness in hyperhidrosis. ETS is carried out under
general anesthesia through one or more small insertion incisions.
Among other things, sympathectomy results in a relaxation of
peripheral arteriovenous connections; this results in vasodilatation
of the skin with increased warmth. It also produces a cessation of
sweating. Beneficial effects reportedly last as long as 5-10 years.</P>
<P>ETS can now often be accomplished on an outpatient basis.</P>
<H4>ETS Contraindications:</H4>
<P>As with any invasive treatment of a non-life-threatening
condition, the risks of hyperhidrosis surgery need to be low. Any
health condition that substantially increases the surgical risk may
make a recommendation for such surgery inappropriate. Specifically,
pulmonary or cardiac pathology may make thoracic surgery, even
endoscopic thoracic surgery, too dangerous for the nature of the
problem.</P>
<P>Patients with only (or predominantly) axillary hyperhidrosis
probably should not be steered toward endoscopic transthoracic
sympathectomy (ETS). Patients with multiple hyperhidrotic sites
should strongly consider ETS before Skoog adenectomy.</P>
<H4>ETS Procedure Details</H4>
<P>Under general anesthsia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube,
with the patient lying supine, on each side two small incisions are
mad between the ribs: one for the endoscopica camera, and the other
to admit endoscopic surgical instruments. One side at a time, the
lung is deflated by the anesthesiologist and the telescope and
instruments introduced. The second rib is identified within the chest
cavity and the sympathetic chain visualized. The pleura is opened
over the symptathetic chain and several sympathetic ganglia
identified (usually T2, T3, and T4). The amount and level of
resection or ablation are individualized somewhat: since innervation
of the head and neck is from T1 to T5, while that of the upper
extremities is from T2 through T9, treatment for facial hyperhidrosis
probably should include the T1 and T2 ganglia, while ablation of T5
probably is required to treat axillary hyperhidrosis. Extensive
proximal dissection of the sympathetic chain (above the T1 ganglia)
may lead to injury of the stellate ganglion, and injury to the
cervical C7 component of this ganglion may result in permanent
postoperative Horner syndrome. The instruments are removed, the lung
reinflated and the incisions closed. A chest tube is not necessary
unless a parenchymal air leak is noted.</P>
<H4>ETS Complications</H4>
<P>In addition to the problems which can be seen after any chest
procedures such as bleeding, infection, incisional problems, and
pneumothorax, patients who have undergone ETS can also experience
compensatory sweating, gustatory sweating, Horner syndrome, eyelid
ptosis, and cardiac effects similar to beta-adrenergic blockade.</P>
<P>In compensatory sweating, patients note increased perspiration
over the trunk and upper thighs, especially in hot weather.
Compensatory sweating may decrease with time, and most patients find
it less objectionable than the hyperhidrosis for which they sought
treatment. If patients are questioned carefully, compensatory
sweating can be noted in as many as 75% of patients undergoing
sympathectomy.</P>
<P>Gustatory sweating is a rare sequela of ETS. These patients
experience the sensation of sweating when they eat, although no
excessive sweat is actually produced.</P>
<P>Postoperative Horner syndrome may occur if portions of the
stellate ganglion are removed or coagulated. This is fairly uncommon
after ETS since the stellate ganglion is well protected by the dome
of the pleura. Eyelid ptosis also may occur following ETS.</P>
<P>Following an extensive thoracic sympathectomy (especially one
extending down to T5), cardiac effects may occur similar to those
produced by beta-adrenergic blockade.</P>
<P>An incomplete sympathectomy may fail to produce symptomatic
relief. Failure to find nerves of Kuntz, if present, also may lead to
a suboptimal result; these extraganglionic sympathetic pathways are
present in at least 10% of patients and must be sought carefully
during the resection procedure.</P>
<H4>ETS Prognosis</H4>
<P>Herbst et al studied 323 patients nearly 15 years after endoscopic
thoracic sympathectomy and summarized their results as follows:</P>
<P>There was no postoperative mortality and no major complications
requiring surgical reintervention. A majority of the patients (98.1%)
were relieved, and 95.5% were satisfied initially. Permanent side
effects included compensatory sweating in 67.4%, gustatory sweating
in 50.7% and Horner's triad in 2.5%. However, patient satisfaction
declined over time, although only 1.5% recurred. This left only 66.7%
satisfied, and 26.7% partially satisfied. Compensatory and gustatory
sweating were the most frequently stated reasons for dissatisfaction.
Individuals operated for axillary hyperhidrosis without palmar
involvement were significantly less satisfied (33.3% and 46.2%,
respectively).</P>
<P>Sympathetic regeneration has been documented in animals and humans
and may result in late recurrence of hyperhidrotic symptoms. In
animals, sympathetic fibers have remarkable regenerative ability,
with regrowth and reinnervation through muscle and scar over time.</P>
<P>To achieve axillary anhidrosis, more extensive and/or more caudal
resection of the sympathetic chain has been advocated, but this also
seems to increase the chances of compensatory sweating and
cardiovascular dysautonomia.</P>
<H2>Axillary resection</H2>
<H3>Skin resection (debulking of gland volume)</H3>
<P>Some authors (Wu et al and others) advocate composite removal of
skin and associated axillary glands to treat axillary hyperhidrosis,
but such resection is likely either to leave behind significant
functional gland tissue or to produce major scarring and limitation
of range of motion. Such resections are more appropriately reserved
for patients with hidradenitis.</P>
<H3>Suction adenectomy</H3>
<P>A liposuction technique has been used to attempt axillary
adenectomy in hyperhidrosis and has been recommended recently by
Lillis and Coleman and Shenaq et al. A small-bore liposuction cannula
is used, with the suction opening turned toward the underside of the
skin. As the cannula is raked across the underside of the skin
bearing the hypertrophic sweat glands, the expectation is that a high
proportion of the glands are either sliced off or disrupted. In the
author's experience, a disappointingly high fraction of patients
treated by this method experienced relapse of abnormal sweating. The
early disappearance of excess sweating is conjectured to be the
result of local denervation and gland disruption; however, as
patients are observed over time, reinnervation and/or gland
regeneration takes place (typically within the first 6 mo
postoperatively), and the symptoms recur. The author has abandoned
this method of treatment.</P>
<P>A variant method of suction adenectomy using ultrasonic
liposuction is thought to produce a better long-term result by
producing more ablation than resection of gland tissue (although this
method is believed to be operator-dependent).</P>
<H3>Open adenectomy (Skoog Procedure)</H3>
<P>The Skoog procedure is a well-tolerated, effective, and permanent
treatment for axillary hyperhidrosis. It is only appropriate for
patients with hyperhidrosis--solely or predominantly--of the axilla.
ETS is the more appropriate choice for patients who also suffer from
palmar or facial hyperhidrosis.</P>
<P>The procedure is named for the late Professor Tord Skoog, of
Uppsala Univerity, Sweden, who developed and popularized the removal
of underarm sweat glands for axillary hyperhidrosis.</P>
<H4>Skoog Contraindications:</H4>
<P>Problems with skin circulation (eg, lupus) or situations known to
degrade wound healing (eg, steroid treatment, previous radiation
therapy, diabetes) may make the risk of surgery unacceptable.</P>
<H4>Skoog Procedure Details</H4>
<P>Axillary adenectomy can easily be done entirely under local
anesthesia; though some patients prefer to be sedated during the
operation (which ususally lasts about 1.5 hours for each side). The
classic Skoog procedure, starts with a transverse incision across the
axilla from front to back; staggered-cross incisions are added
roughly perpendicular to the transverse limb and extending to the
proximal and distal extremes of the hair-bearing area, so that the
entire hair-bearing axilla is divided into 4 quadrants (see Image 1).</P>
<P>In the author's variation of the Skoog procedure, only the single
transverse incision is used. Although this makes the dissection
substantially more difficult, it produces a less visible scar, a
lower risk of flap necrosis, and an easier closure. Wang and others
have recommended multiple parallel longitudinal incisions.</P>
<P>The incisions are carried through the skin and the subcutaneous
layer, which in these patients is formed almost entirely by tan-pink
sweat glands . Usually a fascia layer is discernible covering the
deep axilla; a cleavage plane just superficial to this facilitates
dissection.; none of the dissection is deep to the fascia layer. The
extent of dissection corresponds roughly to the hair-bearing axilla
or to the mapped area if preoperative mapping is used. Reaching the
limits of dissection farthest away from the skin incision becomes
increasingly difficult and requires appropriate instruments and an
experienced assistant.</P>
<P>Gland resection is started most easily at the cut edge of the
incision and proceeds toward the axillary periphery. With practice,
removing essentially all of the gland tissue in a sheet without
damaging the fine vessels revealed on the underside of the dermis by
the resection is possible using magnifying loupes. The gland color
and texture differentiate them from other structures in the operative
field and are the most useful determinants of the adequacy of
extirpation.</P>
<P>The endpoint of gland resection is usually apparent when the
carpet of tan gland tissue runs out. However, peripheral &quot;islands&quot;
or &quot;peninsulas&quot; of glandular tissue covered by a thin layer
of fat may fool the surgeon; missing these small collections of
hypertrophic gland tissue is the probable cause of most sweating
&quot;recurrences&quot; once the missed tissue becomes reinnervated.
A check of the apparent end of hypertrophied gland mass against the
axillary hair pattern or against an outline determined by
preoperative mapping can prevent leaing hypertrophic glands behind.
Dissecting approximately 1 cm beyond the apparent end of the
glandular tissue carpet also may help prevent recurrence without
unduly compromising flap circulation.</P>
<P>The incisions are sutured in layers, and a drain is placed through
a small separate incision at the most inferior extreme of dissection,
since without this step a hematoma or seroma often accumulates.</P>
<P>A padded compression dressing is placed over the entire dissected
area, hinged at the depth of the axilla: this can be made with
resilient padding, bent into a V. The arm side of the V is taped to
the upper arm or held in place with an elastic bandage, while the
chest side of the V is taped to the chest.</P>
<P>The drain may be removed in 24-72 hours. Some kind of padded
compression dressing should remain in place for a week. Skin sutures
can be removed safely at approximately 1 week. Most patients resume
normal arm activity (excluding overhead arm stretching) as soon as
the dressings are removed; exercises that include overhead stretches
can be resumed gradually starting 2 weeks after surgery.</P>
<H4>Skoog ComplicationS</H4>
<P>The most common complications of axillary sweat gland resection
are related to vascularity of the flaps. Overly aggressive dissection
damages the fine vessels that supply the dissected flaps; hematoma
and infection also can act to compromise circulation.</P>
<P>Any but the most minor length of necrosis along the suture line
will lead to dehiscence with consequent discomfort, drainage, and
eventual hypertrophic scar.</P>
<P>Hematoma, seroma, and infection can occur and increase the risk of
flap devascularization despite careful hemostasis, aseptic technique,
preoperative preparation, drain placement, and compressive dressings.</P>
<P>Incomplete excision of a portion of the hypertrophic gland mass
leads to recurrent sweating once the acinar tissue becomes
reinnervated, typically several months after surgery. This is the
most common reason for reoperation.</P>
<P>Although hypertrophic and keloid scars are uncommon in the axilla
with primary healing, they CAN occur and may require triamcinolone
injection, topical silicone gel sheeting, or even revision.</P>
<P>Although compensatory sweating can occur with transthoracic
sympathectomy, it is never observed in axillary adenectomy.</P>
<H4>Skoog Prognosis</H4>
<P>Every dissected (thus denervated) axilla is dry, even if no sweat
glands are resected. Therefore, long-term outcome of sweat gland
resection can only be judged after 6 months, when reinnervation
should already have taken place. Most patients have a dry axilla for
the few months following surgery, then develop some sweating, which
the patients characterize as &quot;normal.&quot; With meticulous
dissection, long-term relief of hyperhidrosis approaches 95%. In a
study of use of a mechanical gland-shaving device, Park et al
reported an overall satisfaction rate of 94.7% with a complication
rate of 13.2%.</P>
