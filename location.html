	Office Location
</h3>
<p>
	Our office is located on the southwest corner of Seventh Avenue and Central Park South (59th Street). It is easily reached by public transportation: the buses and subway lines which service the transportation hub at Columbus Circle stop one block away. Other subway lines running under Sixth and Seventh Avenues have stops one or two blocks away. Several bus lines have stops immediately adjacent to the office. Although driving to midtown may be an adventure, there are several parking garages in the neighborhood. Metered street parking is extremely limited. <!-- TODO: include yahoo maps/mapquest image or link -->

	The <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us">Metropolitan Transit Authority</a> provides a <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/maps/submap.htm">map of the New York City subway system</a>, which you might find helpful. It is also available in <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/maps/subwaymap.pdf">PDF format</a>, which is better for printing and viewing details, but which may take several minutes to download on a dial-up connection.
