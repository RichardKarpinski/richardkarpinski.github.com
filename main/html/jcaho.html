accreditation should be awarded to the practice.</p>
<p>Joint Commission standards deal with quality of care issues and the safety of the environment in which care is
provided. Anyone believing that he or she has pertinent and valid information about such matters may request a public information interview with the Joint Commission's field representative at the time of survey. Information presented at the interview will be carefully evaluated for relevance to the accreditation process. Requests for a public information interview
must be made in writing, and should be sent to the Joint Commission no later than five working days before the survey begins. The request must also indicate the nature of the information to be provided at the interview. Such requests should be addressed to:</p>
