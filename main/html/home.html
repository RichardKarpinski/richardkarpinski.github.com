			<span class="caps">In a city full of Plastic Surgeons</span> (and people who call themselves Plastic Surgeons), this practice distinguishes itself by personal service, extensive experience, and a commitment to thorough postoperative care.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because a patient's safety and satisfaction <i>after</i> surgery is our measure of success, a thorough and honest pre-op evaluation is a hallmark of this practice. This means time spent, questions answered, alternative options investigated, and likely outcomes truthfully represented. Remember:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Not every consultation will lead to surgery.
			</li>
			<li>Surgery is serious, so considering surgery must also be serious.
			</li>
			<li>We avoid sales gimmicks and flashy graphics.
			</li>
			<li>Something novel: <b>we listen to you</b>&#8212;your questions, your concerns.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We have been in practice long enough to be experienced, yet do not turn your care over to assistants at any stage. You will not feel like you've been put on an assembly line. There are also <a href="credentials.html#credentials">unassailable credentials</a>, <a href="credentials.html#training">training at top-notch centers</a>, a pleasant <a href="facilities.html">office surrounding</a>, and personal attention to your needs.
