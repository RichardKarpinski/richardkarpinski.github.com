<h3 class="question" id="certification">What does <i>Board Certification</i> mean?</h3>
<P><b>Board Certification</b> of a physician is a rigorous process of verification and validation of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>licences and credentials,
<LI>satisfactory medical school study and graduation,
<LI>full completion of specialty training in an approved residency program,
<LI>successful performance in strenous certification examinations,
</UL>
<P>with the goal of assuring the public and various medical institutions (like hospitals)
about the legitimacy, training, experience and competence of a practitioner. In the USA
and Canada, physician board certification is overseen by the 
<a href="#abms">American Board of Medical Specialties<a> and its component
certifying boards, such as the <a href="#abps">American Board of Plastic Surgery</a>
and the <a href="#abs">American Board of Surgery<a>.</P>

<h3 class="question" id="abms">What is the <i>American Board of Medical Specialties</i>?</h3>
<P>The <b>American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)</b> is the umbrella organization for the
24 approved medical specialty boards in the United States. Established in 1933, the ABMS
serves to coordinate the activities of its Member Boards and to provide information to
the public, the government, the profession and its Members concerning issues involving
specialization and certification in medicine. The mission of the ABMS is to maintain and
improve the quality of medical care in the United States by assisting the Member Boards
in their efforts to develop and utilize professional and educational standards for the
evaluation and certification of physician specialists.</P>
<P>The governing body of each Member Board is comprised of specialists qualified in the
specialty represented by the board. The individual Member Boards evaluate physician
candidates who voluntarily seek certification by a Member Board of the ABMS. To
accomplish this function, the Member Boards determine whether candidates have received
appropriate preparation in approved residency training programs in accordance with
established educational standards, evaluate candidates with comprehensive examinations,
and certify those candidates who have satisfied the board requirements. Physicians who
are successful in achieving certification are called diplomates of the respective
specialty board. The boards also offer recertification for qualified diplomates at
intervals of seven to ten years.</P>

<h3 class="question" id="abps">What is <i>The American Board of Plastic Surgery</i>?</h3>
<P><b>The American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS)</b> was founded in 1937 and
officially recognized in 1941, for the purpose of certifying those
found to be qualified after meeting specific intensive educational
requirements and completing a multi-part examination process. A major
reason for establishing the specialty board was to identify the
Plastic Surgeon who has met a certain standard of excellence.</P>

		<LI>breadth of experience,
		<LI>competent and ethical treatment,
		<LI>accurate record-keeping;
	</UL>
	<LI>passed both a comprehensive written examination and a separate multi-day oral examination.

organization with worldwide recognition. It is one of the twenty-four
certifying boards that are members of the <A HREF="#abms">American
Board of Medical Specialties</A>. The Directors of the
American Board of Plastic Surgery are distinguished surgeons in
education, research, and practice in the United States.</P>

<h3 class="question" id="aba">What is the <i>American Board of Anesthesiology</i>?</h3>
<!-- TODO: rewrite to match other entries -->
<P>A committee representing the American Society of Anesthetists,
Inc., The American Society of Regional Anesthesia, Inc., and the

standards of the College.</P>
<P>The letters <b>F.A.C.S. (Fellow of the American College of Surgeons)</b>
after a surgeon's name mean that the surgeon's education and
training, professional qualifications, surgical competence, and
ethical conduct have passed a rigorous evaluation and have been found
to be consistent with the high standards established and demanded by
the College.</P>

<h3 class="question" id="jcaho">What is <i>JCAHO</i> and what does <i>accreditation</i> mean?</h3>
<P>The <b>Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)</b> was formed over 50 years ago: the first hospital inspections were performed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) in 1918, based on the ACS Minimum Standard for Hospitals. In 1951, the ACS joined with the American College of Physicians, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the Canadian Medical Association to form the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH)--an independent, not-for-profit organization whose primary purpose was to provide voluntary accreditation. In 1952, JCAH took over the hospital standardization program from ACS.</P>
<P>The mandate of the JCAH was gradually expanded to other health care facilities, like Ambulatory Surgical Centers, Nursing Homes, and now Office Operating Facilities. In 1987, JCAH changed its name to the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations to reflect its expanded scope of activities. At present, JCAHO evaluates the quality and safety of care for nearly 17,000 health care organizations. It is the nation's predominant standards-setting and accrediting body in health care.</P>
<P>Accreditation is a voluntary process: to earn and maintain accreditation, organizations must have an extensive on-site review by a team of JCAHO health care professionals, at least once every three years. The purpose of the review is to evaluate the organization's performance in areas that affect patient care and safety. </P>
<P>JCAHO accreditation is recognized nationwide as a symbol of quality that reflects an organization's commitment to performance standards, safety, and quality. The scrutiny fosters excellence in care through self-study and external review by one's professional peers.</P>

<h3 class="question" id="asps">What is the <i>American Society of Plastic Surgeons</i>?</h3>
<P>The <b>American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS)</b>
is the national organization of Plastic Surgeons in the USA
and Canada. It supports its members in their efforts to provide the
highest quality patient care and seeks to maintain professional and
ethical standards through education, research, and advocacy of
socioeconomic and professional activities.</P>
<P>The society acts as a unifying force among member plastic surgeons
and as a source of organizational strength. It serves the public (as
well as its members) by acting as an authority on plastic surgery
procedures, and a source for research information and health policy
issues. The ASPS also attempts to educate the public and the medical
community about Plastic Surgery, and questions germane to Plastic
Surgery. Its Educational Foundation sponsors research and instruction
in Plastic Surgery.</P>
<P>Because many practitioners can call themselves &quot;Plastic
Surgeons,&quot; the ASPS assists the public by limiting use of its
ASPS 'Symbol of Excellence' to its Active, Life and Corresponding
members.</P>

<h3 class="question" id="hms">Tell me about <i>Harvard Medical School</i>.</h3>
<P><b>Harvard Medical School</b> is one of the foremost institutions in medical education and research, with great breadth and depth to its investigational and clinical departments. The faculty numbers nearly 8,000, and there are 17 affiliated hospital and research institutions. The student body is composed of 650 men and women in the MD program; 477 students in the PhD program; and 132 in the joint MD-PhD programs, part of which is conducted in collaboration with MIT.</P>
<P>On September 19, 1782, the president and fellows of Harvard College adopted a report embodying plans for a medical school. It started with a handful of students and a faculty of three in Harvard Hall. The Medical School moved from Cambridge to Boston in 1810, and has been there ever since, occupying several different locations. In 1906, the Medical School moved to its present Longwood Avenue location in Boston, and the five marble-faced buildings that compose the Quadrangle were dedicated. </P>
<P>The Medical School is the largest of Harvard's graduate faculties, with affiliations among many of greater Boston's univeristy- and community-hospitals. It is located in Boston's Fenway neighborhood, a considerable distance from Harvard's main campus in Cambridge.</P>

<h3 class="question" id="columbia">Tell me about <i>Coumbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons</i>.</h3>
<P>The <b>College of Physicians and Surgeons (P + S)</b> began when
King's College (renamed after the revolution to Columbia University) organized a medical faculty in 1767, and was the first institution in the North American Colonies to confer the degree of Doctor of Medicine.</P>
