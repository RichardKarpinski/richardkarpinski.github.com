			Appointments Policy (including office hours)
		</h3>
		<p>
			Office consultations and visits are by appointment only. Nominal office hours are 9-5, Monday through Thursday.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of demand, and days set aside for surgery, new appointments for routine conditions may require 2-3 weeks—or longer at some times of the year.
		</p>
		<p>
			Urgent situations are accommodated as appropriate, usually within a day or two.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can almost always manage emergency situations within a few hours, assuming surgeon availability.

			Payment Policy
		</h3>
		<p>
			Services covered under insurance plans we participate with are submitted in accordance with plan requirements. Balance billing is also per plan stipulations. We try to work with insurance plans we don't participate with—provided there is an out-of-network option.
		</p>
		<p>
			Payment for non-covered office services is expected at the time of the visit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our cosmetic surgery fees generally follow a preset schedule of prices which we update from time to time; it is compiled with input from practice expenses, national average charges amassed by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, and from surveys of prices in the New York tri-state area. Fee quotations will be honored for 6 months from the date of the consultation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cosmetic Surgery fee payment is due two weeks prior to surgery.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arranging surgery involves the schedules of multiple professional people (surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurse, assistant) and an operating facility. To date we have avoided the approach&mdash;which many other plastic surgery practices take&mdash;of requiring a non-refundable deposit to schedule surgery. Instead, we trust patients to get their payments to us by two weeks prior to surgery. However, if full payment and any required laboratory results are not received by one week prior to surgery, the surgery will be postponed in order to open the operating room schedule and professional schedules to other waiting patients.
