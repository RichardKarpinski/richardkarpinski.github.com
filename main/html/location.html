<h3 id="location">Office Location</h3>

Our office is located on the southwest corner of Seventh Avenue and Central Park South (59th Street).
It is easily reached by public transportation: the buses and subway lines which service the
transportation hub at Columbus Circle stop one block away. Other subway lines running under Sixth and
Seventh Avenues have stops one or two blocks away. Several bus lines have stops immediately adjacent
to the office. Although driving to midtown may be an adventure, there are several parking garages in
the neighborhood. Metered street parking is extremely limited.

The <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us">Metropolitan Transit Authority</a>
provides a <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/maps/submap.htm">map
of the New York City subway system</a>, which you might find helpful.
It is also available in <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/maps/subwaymap.pdf">PDF format</a>,
which is better for printing and viewing details,
but which may take several minutes to download on a dial-up connection.
