Dear Rickypoo,

The top-level directory (where this file resides), is just a holding place for a top-level Makefile 
and for all the "various" subdirectories. The subdirectories are the following:

	- Makefile: manage other directories; run "make help" for details.
	- main:		the main karpinskimd website files.
	- ahh:		the axillary hyperhidrosis files.
	- common:	files shared by main, ahh via symlinks.
	- misc:		random stuff we want to keep around.
	- images:	various images that are relevant.

Anything else is cruft.

Yours,
Dearest, Steffiepoo.
