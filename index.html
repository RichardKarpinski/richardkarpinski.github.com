	<span class="caps">In an area full of Plastic Surgeons</span> (and people who call themselves Plastic Surgeons), this practice distinguishes itself by personal service, extensive experience, and a commitment to thorough postoperative care.
</p>
<p>
	Because a patient's safety and satisfaction <i>after</i> surgery is our measure of success, a thorough and honest pre-op evaluation is a hallmark of this practice. This means time spent, questions answered, alternative options investigated, and likely outcomes truthfully represented&mdash;whether for closure of a skin cancer defect or for a cosmetic liposuction:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Not every consultation will lead to surgery.
	</li>
	<li>Surgery is serious, so considering surgery must also be serious.
	</li>
	<li>Your questions, your concerns will be listened to and weighed (with you and&mdash;if desired&mdash;your family).
	</li>
</ul>
